# SemesterProjekt-gruppe-1

## E-Commerce Shop  
##### By Group 1.1  

## Overview

This **E-Commerce** web-based solution is developed in **C# using Avalonia**. The shop is responsible for exposing products, prices, and shopping features to customers. This document serves as the **2025 semester project** description for the **2nd Semester Software Engineering/Software Technology** study programmes at the **University of Southern Denmark**.

## Project Structure

The project consists of several subsystems, each developed by a separate project group. The interaction between these subsystems is an essential aspect of the project, though the specific system architecture is left as an exercise for the teams.

Each project group is responsible for:
- Developing an **individually testable subsystem** with documented and tested functionality.
- Collaborating with other groups to integrate the subsystems into a **cohesive software system**.
- Identifying stakeholders (other project groups) and defining **interface agreements**.

## Shop

The shop exposes products and prices to customers through a **graphical user interface (GUI)**. Customers, both private and businesses, can search for and purchase products. Additionally, they can explore various content pages with helpful information.

### Key Features:
- Customers can **add products with specific quantities** to a basket.
- The shop **displays the total price** of the items in the basket.
- Customers can **proceed to purchase** their selected products.
- Product data is **fetched from the Product Information Management (PIM) system**.
- Once a purchase is made, an **order is submitted to the Order Management System**.

## Development Process

Project groups will go through the following phases:
1. **Requirement Elicitation** – Understanding the system needs through the case description, literature research, use case identification, and role-playing exercises.
2. **Software Architecture Definition** – Establishing interfaces and communication protocols between subsystems.
3. **Analysis, Design, and Implementation** – Developing the subsystem iteratively and incrementally.
4. **Formal Testing** – Documenting and validating achieved functionality.
5. **System Integration Testing** – Collaborating with other groups to perform end-to-end system testing.

The final system should provide a **seamless user experience**, ensuring that all subsystems work together effectively to meet the project’s objectives.
